# Reusable GitHub Workflows of the Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT)

This repository hosts the reusable GitHub workflows of the [_Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT)_](https://mqt.readthedocs.io).

---

The _[Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT)](https://mqt.readthedocs.io)_ is a collection of software tools for quantum computing that explicitly utilizes this design automation expertise.
It is developed by the [Chair for Design Automation](https://www.cda.cit.tum.de/) at the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/)
as well as the [Munich Quantum Software Company (MQSC)](https://munichquantum.software).
Amongst others, it is part of the [Munich Quantum Software Stack (MQSS)](https://www.munich-quantum-valley.de/research/research-areas/mqss) ecosystem,
which is being developed as part of the [Munich Quantum Valley (MQV)](https://www.munich-quantum-valley.de) initiative.
